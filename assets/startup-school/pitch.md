------------

Version 1:
Clarity - we save you from yourself.

We aim to add friction to your unhealthy habits and bad purchases while making it simpler to make good lifestyle choices.

We will begin as a browser extension that filters out unhealthy and decremental products from online shops you visit. Eventually, we will expand into physical stores and will be able to prevent you from buying unfavorable products by blocking the transaction or even calling your doctor if you are at risk of lapsing.

In terms of monetization, we will report your progress on abstaining from junk food/alcohol/gambling to insurance companies, which would help them decrease/increase your premiums accordingly. Additionally, we may charge fees on purchases that are decremental to your long-term well-being.
