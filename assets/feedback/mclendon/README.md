One-line description:
Clarity - a healthcare prevention software that changes social behavior for the better

Description:
Healthcare prevention is bad business because a healthy person is a non-existent patient. The American Healthcare Crisis is not a healthcare-based problem, it’s a market-based problem. That requires a market-based solution.
Clarity is the first healthcare prevention software that allows physicians and insurance providers to see what their patients consume in real-time, thanks to the information from recent transactions and location history. This allows Clarity to score patients’ eating habits, which in turn will give health insurance providers more data for fine-tuning insurance premiums. Users will be encouraged to eat healthy to lower their insurance costs and will have an option to block transactions involving unhealthy products altogether.

Context:
We are currently researching the possibility of integrating with bank APIs (Bank of America), payment platforms (Apple Pay, Stripe), and individual retailers (Uber Eats) to get real-time information of when a person bought some food and what food they bought.
We also are keeping an eye on The Open Banking Initiative, which would lead to banks making it easier to get customers' transaction metadata, which would be at the core of our service.
In the meanwhile, we could begin in a digital realm as a browser extension that either removes all unhealthy products from digital marketplaces (i.e, amazon; would act like an ad blocker, but for unhealthy food rather than ads) or tracks and reports what food items you bought.
We could also gather location data in some way to see if a person went to a fast-food restaurant VS Whole Foods.

The repository contains way more information about Clarity, example payload that we can report to health insurance companies and references.

I gave some feedback to Morgan on this during a 1:1 a couple of weeks ago.  

Further thoughts:
- as a consumer, why would I do this?  What's my motivation?
- analogy: black boxes for cars provided by insurance companies in exchange for reduced rates
- as a consumer, I'm giving up a lot of privacy for this, so benefits should be strong.  
- if consumer agrees to monitoring of purchases _and_ pledges not to cheat by regularly getting bad food elsewhere, then I could imagine the insurance discount could pay for a person's food bill (hypothesis)
- as I suggested before, grocery stores keep track of all items purchased tied to your affinity card, so partnering with them seems like first step



Thank you for your feedback. It was very helpful. See our responses in gray below:


Further thoughts:
As a consumer, why would I do this? What's my motivation? (as a consumer, I'm giving up a lot of privacy for this, so benefits should be strong.)

As a consumer there are two sets of motivations for onboarding clarity.

Financial motivation - Lowered health premium costs
This way, Clarity makes healthy food more affordable for families that would otherwise eat unhealthy to save money.
Health management Motivation
Clarity compels good life choices by making healthy decisions easier while adding friction for purchases that are decremental to you in the long term (or blocking them entirely).
Thus, it’s not just about the lower insurance premium. Consumers also get the following benefits:
A summary of your eating habits and tips for improvement. This way, Clarity serves as an all-in-one tool to automatically manage your nutrient intake.
An ability to block transactions on all products that are not beneficial for you in the long term. This serves as insurance from a lapse of judgment on a bad day.
Ability to set up a similar block on your children’s accounts for added peace of mind.
A value add service: We can rate products in the local food stores to give you a better idea of what is really healthy, and what is just fancy marketing and a waste of money.

If consumer agrees to monitoring of purchases _and_ pledges not to cheat by regularly getting bad food elsewhere, then I could imagine the insurance discount could pay for a person's food bill (hypothesis)
Even if the user is willing to cheat, the added friction would make it less convenient, and thus less likely. Plus, the benefit of possible premium reduction should serve as an incentive to keep up with good behavior.
As I suggested before, grocery stores keep track of all items purchased tied to your affinity card, so partnering with them seems like first step.
The biggest challenge here is figuring out what’s in this for the grocery stores. If a customer is no longer able to buy soda drinks in Dillons, they would go somewhere else, and Dillons loses.
One possible solution (inspired by Humana) is to give customers a Dillons gift card for healthy purchases rather than an insurance cost reduction. Humans are more sensitive to receiving “free money”, than savings on recurring expenses. Dillons will be happy with this as the gift cards would tie consumers with Dillons in order to spend the gift card balance.
