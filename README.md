Clarity is a software project that aims to mitigate the burden of chronic disease in America by applying an intermediary layer of computation behind every food and drug related transaction made by all individuals in our economy today.

We believe that software can and should be capable to change behavior for the better and we believe that a new paradigm of healthcare prevention software can realize that belief system.
