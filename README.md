### Mission Statement
david is a software project that aims to mitigate the burden of chronic disease in America by applying an intermediary layer of computation behind every food and drug related transaction made by all individuals in our economy today.  We believe that software can and should be capable to change behavior for the better and we believe that a new paradigm of healthcare prevention software can realize that belief system.

### Pitch

david is the first healthcare prevention and health management software that allows for physicians and insurance providers to see what their patients consume in real-time.

### Problem for Insurance Provider

In 2009 a board of physicians at the institute of medicine discovered that ~30% of health spending is waste.  

[The cost of healthcare to the U.S. economy is ~4 trillion dollars per year.](#### [Congressional Budget Office. “Health Care and the Budget: Issues and Challenges for Reform.” CBO Testimony, 21 June 2007.])

If we help insurance providers in reducing this waste




### Product Solution for Insurers

Population health management software.
Data Collection and Platform Infrastructure


1.  Clarity collects an individual’s food & drug related transactions. 
2.  Parse and generates a patient profile nutritional data structure from those transactions.
3.  Integrate and pipeline that data into pre-existing legacy software to reduce onboarding expenses.

We provide entitlement's nutritional intake behavioral patterns, by providing food and drug related transactional metadata for insurers.  

By providing nutritional data on transactions made for an insurance provider's entitlement population we help reduce waste.

How do we reduce waste?

### Product for Providers

Pipeline that data structure in pre-existing web based EMS portal.  (EMS - electronic medical records systems).

> Total Federal Spending for Medicare and Medicaid Under Assumptions About the Health Cost Growth Differential.  The health cost growth differential refers to the number of percentage points by which the growth of annual health care spending per beneficiary is assumed to exceed the growth of nominal gross domestic product per capita, after an adjustment for the growth and aging of the Medicare and Medicaid populations.  This study presents CBO’s projections of federal spending on Medicare and Medicaid and health care spending generally over the next 75 years. Despite the substantial uncertainties surrounding projections over that long a period, particularly ones involving the growth of health care costs, such a horizon is useful for illustrating the long-term fiscal challenges that this country faces.
