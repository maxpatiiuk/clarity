#### questions addressed
**1.  Define the problem statement**

Most deaths in the United States are preventable, and they are related to what we consume.  Today there is no software that informs consumers on their diet behaviors automatically.   Additionally, healthcare providers have streamlined access to a patient's medical history, current medications, and supplements, however providers do not have access to a patient's diet history.  Now, currently obesity kills more people than starvation (World Health Organization), processed meat for example can be classified as a Group 1, carcinogenic to hlsumans (WHO), and according to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluations at the University of Washington, poor diet alone is one of the top leading risk factors for disease-related deaths, not just in the United States, but in the majority of developed countries around the world (Afshin 1). Therefore, indicating that obesity is not solely a medical problem that requires intervention, but rather a market based problem. https://www.iarc.who.int/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/pr240_E.pdf
Currently today healthcare focuses on illness, rather than wellness.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Our users are individuals worldwise who suffer from any of the following disorders Alcohol User Disorder, Tobacco Use Disorder, Nicotine Use Dependence Disorder, or have cardiovascular disease, with mild, moderate, and severe sub-classifications.

Chronic diseases are a tremendous burden to both patients and the health care system and it is only increasing over time.

Chronic diseases are also the leading drivers of health care costs in the United States (2). In 2016, total direct costs for health care treatment of chronic diseases were more than $1 trillion, with diabetes, Alzheimer’s, and osteoarthritis being the most expensive (2,7). If lost economic productivity is also considered, the total cost of chronic diseases increases to $3.7 trillion, which is close to one-fifth of the entire US economy (7,8). These costs are expected to increase as the population ages — projections indicate that by 2030, more than 80 million people in the United States will have at least 3 chronic diseases (7).
Clinical preventive strategies are available for many chronic diseases; these strategies include intervening before disease occurs (primary prevention), detecting and treating disease at an early stage (secondary prevention), and managing disease to slow or stop its progression (tertiary prevention). These interventions, combined with lifestyle changes, can substantially reduce the incidence of chronic disease and the disability and death associated with chronic disease (9). However, clinical preventive services are substantially underutilized despite the human and economic burden of chronic diseases, the availability of evidence-based tools to prevent or ameliorate them, and the effectiveness of prevention strategies (9–11). For example, in 2015, only 8% of US adults aged 35 or older received all recommended, high-priority, appropriate clinical preventive services, and nearly 5% received none (12).

**2.  Problem statement expanded**

The majority of healthcare in America today directs medicine to invervention, clarity adds a new paradigm in healthcare prevention.  Most dealths in the United States are preventable, and they are related to what we eat.  Clarity aims to provide healthcare providers, insurance companies, and patients with the tools to understand and control consumption patterns related to food and drug patient's transactional metadata.

**3.  The setting of the problem**

point of sale

**4.  How is the problem growing?**

The amount of first world countries that are emerging today from developed countries is increasing and as countries become more developed there is correlation in the increase in chronic disease.  Additionally the burden of chronic disease is increasing whereby healthcare currently consists of over 30% of GDP and is expected to rise in the next decade.

**5.  Who is your user?**

Type 1: User is a health conscious individual that wants to live a healthy life. 

Type 2: User that is incentivized by the opportunity to lower premiums

**6.  What is your user's problem?**

Our users don’t understand their consumption behavior objectively.  Consumers don’t have a software application that tracks health consumption data, additionally consumers have no means of sharing their nutritional information to their doctor automatically.

**7.  How serious, big, immediate, frequent is the problem?**

Most deaths in the United States are preventable, and they are related to what we eat (4).  Our diet is the number-one cause of premature death and the number-one cause of disability (5).  Surely, diet must also be the number-one thing taught in medical schools, right?  Sadly, it’s not. According to the most recent national survey, only a quarter of medical schools offer a single course in nutrition, down from 37 percent thirty years ago (6).

**8.  How will you go about implementing your solution**

How will you go about implementing your solution?
Our solution would be in the form of a mobile app which requires two inputs that tracks food and drug related expenses.  Every time you make a transaction with your card, it would go through and see what food you purchased and then it would be able to analyze that and synthesize all of the nutritional data and provide that data to users in an ingestible format.

Clarity is a new Healthcare Prevention Paradigm




**9.  The solution statement**

Clarity is a new Healthcare Prevention Paradigm

Clarity is a web application that analyzes users' food purchases and generates nutritional metadata. The user would have complete control over their data, which they could share with healthcare providers.  The purpose of clarity is to provide clarity to who consumes what in our marketplace.  Specifically which individuals consume what food/drug via transactional survalience
##A Software that informs what a patient/user consumes to healthcare and insurance providers.
A software that analyzes user’s transactional data


**10. Describe what your company does in 50 characters or less**

Clarity is a data science company.  The mission of clarity is to organize and understand quantitative meta data on human's food/drug consumption and spending.

**11. Why did you choose this idea to work on?**

Currently today healthcare focuses on illness, rather than wellness; whereby less than 10% of healthcare is preventative, the rest is intervention.  The reason why we choose this idea is that we believe the current healthcare system today is unsustainable and does not address mitigating disease with lifestyle through systematic processes.

**12. Do you have domain expertise in this area?** 

no

**13. How do you know pepple need what you're making?**

I need this product (Me Morgan Bergen).  And I know there are millions like me that wishes that my behavior could be changed by software for the better and to better increase my health.

**14. What substitues do people resort to because it doesn't exist today?**

There are two forms of substitutes that individuals resort to in order to provide consumption information and minimizing the forms of consumption that harms health.  Individuals resort to healthcare intervention or disiciple in order to maintain an optimal state of health.

**15. Why would someone use this if they already care about their health?**

This answer can only be provided on a subjective level with a certain level of projection and probability of other human's disposition or motivation.  

Subjectively speaking I am someone who cares about my health, however I still will consume products that are sold in our marketplace that disrupt and harm my health.   

**16. Who are your competitors and who might become competitors?**

In the conventional sense, our competitors are non-existent; meaning there are no software companies that scrape transactional metadata for healthcare purposes.  However, maybe we do have competitors, but currently our research does not indicate that there are companies doing this.  Define what a competitor is?  Is a company that is trying to solve a similar problem.  With this definition in mind our industry competitors are every healthcare service that treats lifestyle driven chronic disease.

The competitors in the current field would be industries and government initatives that drive to increase awareness and education on nutrition and lifestyle.  

**17. How will you make money / define your business model?**

The software service we are providing to consumers is free.
However the software product we are providering to insurance companies and healthcare providers will be a data structure, the data that fills the structure is allocated by the software service we provide to consumers.  

**18.  What do you understand about your business that other companies in it just don't get**

We believe that healthcare prevention is still profitable and can be capatalized and can conform to the current economic system that exists today.

# Clarity Pitch Deck Brainstorming
Payden Brunton, Morgan Bergen
Start Date:  Fri April 22 2022

Guideline Questions
1.  What is your user and what is their problem?
Your audience should agree unequivocally that this is a real problem worth solving. Use compelling user quotes.
Our users are Americans who suffer from Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD), Tobacco Use Disorder (TUD), or 
Nicotine Use Dependence Disorder (NUD) with mild, moderate, and severe sub-classifications.  The problem is that the market for legal substances today is economically incentivized to maximize the amount of sales of their products to customers, although government programs are intended to reduce this market propensity (research to back to specific programs), this is not enough.  
Their problem is that the marketing and advertising and the existence of alcohol and drug saturated environments today in America influences the behavior of individuals. (Definition of Public Health in regards to systemic change, Find some statistic on rates of out-patient relapse for treatment centers.)
The problem that our user's face today is that there are no tools that they can use in order to track, manage, or regulate their spending patterns on Alcohol.  
One major systemic problem found in our healthcare system is that healthcare is focused on illness and not on wellness.
Any treatment: Treatment received at any location, such as a hospital (inpatient), rehabilitation facility (inpatient or outpatient), mental health center, ED, private doctor’s office, self-help group, or prison/jail.
The treatment that patients receive outweighs the prevention they need.  At the end of the day, if someone has access to alcohol and there are large companies that are incentivized to gain in order to increase that access, then recovery for patients will continue to be ever more difficult.
The major problem that we are solving here is that 14.5 million Americans suffer from Alcohol Use Disorder (cite). Over 90% of healthcare today is focused on intervention, clarity is intended to focus on prevention.

2.  How serious, big, and immediate is this problem?  
“With [your product], [user x] can [do what?]”.  Use a screencast or demo to illustrate.
With clarity, Johnny Appleseed can ensure that if relapses and attempts to purchase alcohol, his card would get declined.  With clarity, Johnny Appleseed can leave an alcohol treatment center and know that there is friction between his access to alcohol which will help protect him from relapse.
Our solution will mitigate this societal problem and will increase friction to access.
Clarity is not a cure all and is not intended to solve all the problems that exist in the marketplace today, clarity is just another tool in someone's recovery toolbox.
Some trend in rates of relapse or diagnosis of alcohol use dependence 

3.  How will you go about implementing your solution?
What have you accomplished thus far (research, testing, iteration)?
We will be developing a credit card that declines whenever the user tries to purchase alcohol.Once declined the user will get a notification through our mobile app. The user will be incentivized to make purchases with the card due to our unique reward system. 
Reward System: 
The users cashback rates will be determined by the card usage and attempts to purchase alcohol ratio. 
The cashback the users will receive will be in clarity points. Users will be able to convert the points into cash or any reward we have on the shop. 

4.  Who else is doing this (competitors), and why do you have an unfair advantage?
Keyword Search

5.  Define your business model
Business Model 1:
Tracking credit card transaction history and providing that data to healthcare insurance companies.

6.  What do you want from your audience whom you are pitching to  and what will you do with it?
Example:  We want to produce Y, and in order to do so we need investment of Y to cover material costs.




Story
Alcohol addiction is something that affects everyone, not just the individual. I come from a long line of addicts who were abusive and caused a large amount of trauma in my family. At Clarity we hope that nobody has to go through that experience. To be continued……We want to mitigate alcohol consumption with our credit card and app. Whenever a user tries to purchase alcohol from any store the card will decline and you will get a notification telling you why it declined. To incentivize good card behavior we will give select rewards determining on usage and times trying to purchase alcohol.


Research Tasks
Figure out the technical aspect of credit cards

Research Problem Statistics

Solution Research
A credit card that doesn't allow the purchase of alcohol 
Terminal Gateway blocker software, essentially a software that requires a user to input their payment information and with that information our company has access to freeze their card when the location of their card is within a 50 meter radius from an alcohol store. 
How the credit card works, the card would track everything you bought and cancel the entire transaction, then thereafter the user would receive an in-app notification flagging to the user that this item is the reason why the purchase failed. 
A data tracking software that feeds data regarding individual bank statements, or credit card transactions and sells that data to insurance companies.  
What if we had separate types of cards that would be specific towards the items in which you purchase

Notes
Provide alarming statistics on the problem.
i.g. top 15 killers in america (heart disease, diabetes, cancer, stroke, other)
Abstract Mission Statement:  To make sure that our product is NOT a luxury good, that the barriers to entry are low, and the incentives to use this product are high. aka make sure that low income people can access this card.
Potentially contact Amanda Nelson 
Contact Launch Lawrence
We must incentivize our users to avoid them using a different card.

Glossary
Alcohol use disorder: A chronic brain disorder marked by compulsive drinking, loss of control over alcohol use, and negative emotions when not drinking. AUD can be mild, moderate, or severe. Recovery is possible regardless of severity. The DSM-IV, published by the American Psychiatric Association, described two distinct disorders—alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence—with specific criteria for each. The fifth edition, DSM-5, integrates the two DSM-IV disorders into a single disorder called AUD, with mild, moderate, and severe subclassifications.
Any treatment: Treatment received at any location, such as a hospital (inpatient), rehabilitation facility (inpatient or outpatient), mental health center, ED, private doctor’s office, self-help group, or prison/jail.

Notes

What if we have deals with specific healthcare providers and they would pay us.  
Less than 10% of healthcare is directed towards prevention, whereby the majority of healthcare is focused on intervention.  
Clarity is a software company that analyzes an individual's transactional data and feeds that data to insurance providers, physicians, pharmacists, etc. Additionally it analyzes your behavior and gives you notifications based on your spending patterns and information on what you purchased.
If person x purchases a beef jersey we would flag that itemized purchase and you would get a notification providing you information about that product and how it is linked to colorectal cancer or provide you some informational notification about how many times you’ve purchased it.
Is a software company that analyzes an individual's transactional data and feeds that data to insurance providers, physicians, pharmacists, etc. Additionally it analyzes your behavior and gives you notifications based on your spending patterns and information on what you purchased.

Clarity is a software that collects and analyzes individuals transactional data 
sell data structure of an individual's transactional data 
a consumer application that provides summaries reports on your food/drug related tracking, and thus consumption.

So clarity would essentially be a software company that analyzes an individuals transactional data and feeds that data to insurance providers, physicians, pharmacists, etc additionally it analyzes your behavior and gives you notifications based on your spending patterns and information on what you purchased.

I believe that so many chronic diseases in America can be attributed to abject lifestyle.  Our software would monitor transactions made by individuals from retails that sell food products that are classified as group 1 carcinogens, highly refined processed foods, or is a chemical substance (e.g. alcohol, nicotine, cannabis). 

If person x purchases a beef jersey we would flag that itemized purchase and you would get a notification providing you information about that product and how it is linked to colorectal cancer or provide you some informational notification about how many times you’ve purchased it.

I would like to invent a software that monitors and/or blocks specified transactions from retailers that sell food products that are classified as group 1 carcinogens or are classified as highly processed.  This software would be best for patients who have substance abuse disorders, so if you are a chronic smoker and you attempt to purchase cigarettes or you have alcohol dependence your payment would decline, your insurance company would flag that transaction, and you’d get a notification from your physicians exchange on immediate care/support to ensure you don't “relapse”.  That's a high level overview
