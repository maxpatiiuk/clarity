# clarity draft pitch

#### questions addressed
**1.  Define the problem statement**

Most deaths in the United States are preventable, and they are related to what we consume.  Today there is no software that informs consumers on their diet behaviors automatically.   Additionally, healthcare providers have streamlined access to a patient's medical history, current medications, and supplements, however providers do not have access to a patient's diet history.  Now, currently obesity kills more people than starvation (World Health Organization), processed meat for example can be classified as a Group 1, carcinogenic to hlsumans (WHO), and according to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluations at the University of Washington, poor diet alone is one of the top leading risk factors for disease-related deaths, not just in the United States, but in the majority of developed countries around the world (Afshin 1). Therefore, indicating that obesity is not solely a medical problem that requires intervention, but rather a market based problem. https://www.iarc.who.int/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/pr240_E.pdf
Currently today healthcare focuses on illness, rather than wellness.



**2.  Problem statement expanded**

The majority of healthcare in America today directs medicine to invervention, clarity adds a new paradigm in healthcare prevention.  Most dealths in the United States are preventable, and they are related to what we eat.  Clarity aims to provide healthcare providers, insurance companies, and patients with the tools to understand and control consumption patterns related to food and drug patient's transactional metadata.

**3.  The setting of the problem**

**4.  How is the problem growing?**

The amount of first world countries that are emerging today from developed countries is increasing and as countries become more developed there is correlation in the increase in chronic disease.  Additionally the burden of chronic disease is increasing whereby healthcare currently consists of over 30% of GDP and is expected to rise in the next.

**5.  Who is your user?**

Type 1: User is a health conscious individual that wants to live a healthy life. 

Type 2: User that is incentivized by the opportunity to lower premiums

**6.  What is your user's problem?**

Our users don’t understand their consumption behavior objectively.  Consumers don’t have a software application that tracks health consumption data, additionally consumers have no means of sharing their nutritional information to their doctor automatically.

**7.  How serious, big, immediate, frequent is the problem?**

Most deaths in the United States are preventable, and they are related to what we eat (4).  Our diet is the number-one cause of premature death and the number-one cause of disability (5).  Surely, diet must also be the number-one thing taught in medical schools, right?  Sadly, it’s not. According to the most recent national survey, only a quarter of medical schools offer a single course in nutrition, down from 37 percent thirty years ago (6).

**8.  How will you go about implementing your solution**

How will you go about implementing your solution?
Our solution would be in the form of a mobile app which requires two inputs that tracks food and drug related expenses.  Every time you make a transaction with your card, it would go through and see what food you purchased and then it would be able to analyze that and synthesize all of the nutritional data and provide that data to users in an ingestible format.



**9.  The solution statement**

Clarity is a web application that analyzes users' food purchases and generates nutritional metadata. The user would have complete control over their data, which they could share with healthcare providers.  The purpose of clarity is to provide clarity to who consumes what in our marketplace.  Specifically which individuals consume what food/drug via transactional survalience
##A Software that informs what a patient/user consumes to healthcare and insurance providers.
A software that analyzes user’s transactional data


**10. Describe what your company does in 50 characters or less**

Clarity is a data science company.  The mission of clarity is to organize and understand quantitative meta data on human's food/drug consumption and spending.

**11. Why did you choose this idea to work on?**

Currently today healthcare focuses on illness, rather than wellness; whereby less than 10% of healthcare is preventative, the rest is intervention.  The reason why we choose this idea is that we believe the current healthcare system today is unsustainable and does not address mitigating disease with lifestyle through systematic processes.

**12. Do you have domain expertise in this area?** 

no

**13. How do you know pepple need what you're making?**

I need this product (Me Morgan Bergen).  And I know there are millions like me that wishes that my behavior could be changed by software for the better and to better increase my health.

**14. What substitues do people resort to because it doesn't exist today?**

There are two forms of substitutes that individuals resort to in order to provide consumption information and minimizing the forms of consumption that harms health.  Individuals resort to healthcare intervention or disiciple in order to maintain an optimal state of health.

**15. Why would someone use this if they already care about their health?**

This answer can only be provided on a subjective level with a certain level of projection and probability of other human's disposition or motivation.  

Subjectively speaking I am someone who cares about my health, however I still will consume products that are sold in our marketplace that disrupt and harm my health.   

**16. Who are your competitors and who might become competitors?**

In the conventional sense, our competitors are non-existent; meaning there are no software companies that scrape transactional metadata for healthcare purposes.  However, maybe we do have competitors, but currently our research does not indicate that there are companies doing this.  Define what a competitor is?  Is a company that is trying to solve a similar problem.  With this definition in mind our industry competitors are every healthcare service that treats lifestyle driven chronic disease.

The competitors in the current field would be industries and government initatives that drive to increase awareness and education on nutrition and lifestyle.  

**17. How will you make money / define your business model?**

The software service we are providing to consumers is free.
However the software product we are providering to insurance companies and healthcare providers will be a data structure, the data that fills the structure is allocated by the software service we provide to consumers.  

**18.  What do you understand about your business that other companies in it just don't get**

We believe that healthcare prevention is still profitable and can conform to the current economic system that exists today.
